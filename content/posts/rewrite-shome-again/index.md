# rewrite the code again

i want to make it easy for me to add new stuff, and its the 5th time i rewrite the whole code.
i keep forgetting what i code and how i do it, and then thare is that script v2 thing and custom command, so i just make thing up to patch it and the code is a mess(for me) because of it.
now i want to code it so that its eazy to fix and update.

so yeah, thats it.
oh and i want to add public home so you can let other to tp to your home.
bye
