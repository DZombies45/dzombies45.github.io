### how to use

go to my github repo [here](https://github.com/DZombies45/MCBE-CustomCommand) and see its page, or use [this link](https://dzombies45.github.io/MCBE-CustomCommand/) for the wiki page.

this use minecraft's own api [CustomCommandRegistry](https://learn.microsoft.com/id-id/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/customcommandregistry?view=minecraft-bedrock-experimental&viewFallbackFrom=minecraft-bedrock-stable) for custom command

it make the making of custom command easyer to read and understand (thats what i hope)
