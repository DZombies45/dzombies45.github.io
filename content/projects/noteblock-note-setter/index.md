# working on it

it's an addon that will make changing noteblock note easy with ui (fornow)

so it seems making it its own block will be hard, so will need to wait till we can check restone update on custom block
like its posible with tick interval, but when i test it, it will lag after some block is placed on low end device, so ill wait till then

## **todo**

- [x] Make UI to change it
- [ ] Add block to replace it
- [ ] Make crafting for it
- [ ] Add sound and particle for each note
- [ ] Add all(most) sound type block
