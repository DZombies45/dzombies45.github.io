# what to do

so i here is what i want to add when i update this addon, so unless i add 1 of this thisng, i won't upload the update event if the new version is up, ill do this first.

- [x] item durability limit
- [x] new setting ui using action bar/title
- [x] easy custom sort system
- [x] inv sort function
- [ ] auto add from sellected chest
- [ ] auto sort to/from chest
- [ ] better item(enchant) filter
- [x] make sort template

# why do i use action event

so basicly no easy way to detect inventory is open or close at the moment, so i need to use every action player can use.
